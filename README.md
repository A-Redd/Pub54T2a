T2A on ServUO Publish54. 
Want a pre-aos server using servuo with Ascii text, dice rolls for weapons and insta hit? This is an attemot to create that.
Im a complete programing noob, so much of this was very trial and error, so there may be a lot or bad practice/crappy code as I try to stumble through this. Much of it has been taken from other distros such as UOG:Rebirth


**-Whats been worked on so far so far-**

1. Ascii text for singleclick 90 done% Im having some crashes with this.
2. Ciloc converted to ascii
3. Dice weapon damage (most weapons have been converted to this system) 
4. BaseArmor fix. No more constant 1 damage hits from mobs.
