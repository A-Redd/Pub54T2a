# Pub54T2a
T2A on ServUO Publish54. 

A pre-aos server/template using servuo. Features Ascii text, dice rolls for weapons and soon, insta hit. 
Im a complete programing noob, so much of this is very trial and error, so there may be a lot or bad practice/crappy code as I try to stumble through it. Much of this has been converted from other distros such as UOG:Rebirth


**-Whats been worked on so far so far-**

1. Ascii text for singleclick.
2. Cliloc converted to ascii.
3. Dice weapon damage.
4. BaseArmor fix. No more constant 1 damage hits from mobs.
5. more accurate monster stats for era.
6.
